# EMI Signal Generator & RF Interference Study 📶

## Project Overview
This project involved the development of a prototype Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) generator. The goal was to simulate controlled RF interference to study signal disruption and test the effectiveness of different electromagnetic shielding materials.

## Technical Details
* **Purpose:** Foundational research for advanced anti-jamming communication systems.
* **Core Concepts:** RF Interference, Signal Integrity, and Electromagnetic Shielding.
* **Development:** Hardware prototype built to generate localized EMI.

## Documentation
